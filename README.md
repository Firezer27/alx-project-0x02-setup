# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This repository contains the initial setup for a Next.js project using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.  
It is part of the ALX Frontend Specialization and serves as the foundation for building a modern, well-structured web application.

The goal of this repository is to:

- Set up the base project structure
- Prepare the environment for Next.js development
- Ensure proper configuration for TypeScript and Tailwind
- Start the journey toward building reusable components and pages

More features and project files will be added in later tasks as the project progresses.
